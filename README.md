# About App

A smart app that would adapt your environment to your needs. Using a wearable Device and the power of Google AI we try to detect and help you get through your struggles throughout the day and night

## Using the Mobile Application

The Sign Up and Log in function does not work yet, so just click **Sign Up** to begin to use the application as it takes you directly to the onboarding screen explaining the aim of the app with how to use it.

Then next to the Home Screen, the first card under **Features** named **Nightmare** is clickable to show the main idea of the application.

### Implemented Buttons/Features

The rate your sleep button works with the idea of allowing the user rate last nights sleep. Click the **Enter a Google Home command button** to enter a command and then click save to go back. Now you can click the **simulate trigger** to simulate the trigger of sending a command to Googl Assistant (this will be done by the watch for the main implementation).
